# Maria Kuprikova Senior Project
 - This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.3. You will need to install Angular on your machine as well as Node.js and Yarn. 
 - Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
 - Run `npm start` to run the program. 

## Description

This research project aims to study key concepts of computational physics by creating a simulation of gravity, with a focus on its implementation and design of the simulation itself. The project involves building up a solid knowledge of physics and differential equations that are required for accurate simulations and exploring the limits of simulations compared to real-life experimentation. It takes the concepts of physics and programming and demonstrates their intersection, showing how physics simulations are important for scientists to better visualize and understand the world around us. By making a fun yet educational web application that can be used by a variety of people, I want to emphasize the importance of a well-designed user interface in creating a positive user experience. My ultimate goal is to demonstrate my expertise and capabilities in creating a complex program through this project.
